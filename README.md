Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engeneering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.It involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Developing programming Languages.
Establishing of software engeneering as a discipline in the 1960s.
Creating sostwares such as Agile.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases, including:
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
  - Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Impotance of using version control software is a best practice for high performing software and DevOps teams. Version control also helps developers move faster and allows software teams to preserve efficiency and agility as the team scales to include more developers.
 eg - Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
eg - Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
- Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
- Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.

 
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
The significance of interacting with AI models is to broaden the solutions of the request.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
The example is : Tell me about cars.
Improvement : Tell me how to fix a BMW car Radio.
The reason why the improved prompt is more effective is because the request is clear, specific, and concise.
